# Animate

Simple interface to introduce animations to components.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Animate, Notice } from '@wordpress/components'; const MyAnimatedNotice = () => ( <Animate type="slide-in" options={ { origin: 'top' } }> { ( { className } ) => ( <Notice className={ className } status="success"> <p>Animation finished.</p> </Notice> ) } </Animate>);
```

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | `undefined` | Type of the animation to use. |
| `options` | `object` | `{}` | Options of the chosen animation. |
| `children` | `function` | `undefined` | A callback receiving a list of props ( `className` ) to apply to the DOM element to animate. |

## Available Animation Types

### appear

This animation is meant for popover/modal content, such as menus appearing. It shows the height and width of the animated element scaling from 0 to full size, from its point of origin.

#### Options

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `origin` | `string` | `top center` | Point of origin (`top`, `bottom`,`middle right`, `left`, `center`). |

### loading

This animation is meant to be used to indicate that activity is happening in the background. It is an infinitely-looping fade from 50% to full opacity. This animation has no options, and should be removed as soon as its relevant operation is completed.

### slide-in

This animation is meant for sidebars and sliding menus. It shows the height and width of the animated element moving from a hidden position to its normal one.

#### Options

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `origin` | `string` | `left` | Point of origin (`left`). |
