# DateTime

DateTimePicker is a React component that renders a calendar and clock for date and time selection. The calendar and clock components can be accessed individually using the `DatePicker` and `TimePicker` components respectively.

## Best practices

Date pickers should:

- Use smart defaults and highlight the current date.

## Usage

Render a DateTimePicker.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';import { DateTimePicker } from '@wordpress/components'; const MyDateTimePicker = () => { const [ date, setDate ] = useState( new Date() ); return ( <DateTimePicker currentDate={ date } onChange={ ( newDate ) => setDate( newDate ) } is12Hour={ true } /> );};
```

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

### currentDate: Date | string | number | null

The current date and time at initialization. Optionally pass in a `null` value to specify no date is currently selected.

- Required: No
- Default: today’s date

### onChange: ( date: string | null ) =&gt; void

The function called when a new date or time has been selected. It is passed the `currentDate` as an argument.

- Required: No

### is12Hour: boolean

Whether we use a 12-hour clock. With a 12-hour clock, an AM/PM widget is displayed and the time format is assumed to be `MM-DD-YYYY` (as opposed to the default format `DD-MM-YYYY`).

- Type: `bool`
- Required: No
- Default: false

### dateOrder: ‘dmy’ | ‘mdy’ | ‘ymd’

The order of day, month, and year. This prop overrides the time format determined by `is12Hour` prop.

- Type: `string`
- Required: No
- Default: `'dmy'`

### isInvalidDate: ( date: Date ) =&gt; boolean

A callback function which receives a Date object representing a day as an argument, and should return a Boolean to signify if the day is valid or not.

- Required: No

### onMonthPreviewed: ( date: string ) =&gt; void

A callback invoked when selecting the previous/next month in the date picker. The callback receives the new month date in the ISO format as an argument.

- Required: No

### [events: { date: Date }\[\]](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/date-time/#events-date-date)

List of events to show in the date picker. Each event will appear as a dot on the day of the event.

- Type: `Array`
- Required: No

### startOfWeek: number

The day that the week should start on. 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.

- Required: No
- Default: 0
