# @wordpress/interactivity

The package `@wordpress/interactivity` contains the logic that enables the Interactivity API which was [introduced in WordPress Core in v6.5](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/19/merge-announcement-interactivity-api/). This means this package is already bundled in Core in any version of WordPress higher than v6.5.

Check the [Interactivity API Reference docs in the Block Editor handbook](../../04-interactivity-api-reference/index.md) to learn more about the Interactivity API.

## Installation

Install the Interactivity API using the command:

```bash
npm install @wordpress/interactivity --save
```

This step is only required if you use the Interactivity API outside WordPress.

Within WordPress, the package is already bundled in Core. To ensure it’s loaded, add `@wordpress/interactivity` to the dependency array of the script module. This process is often done automatically with tools like [`wp-scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-scripts/).

Furthermore, this package assumes your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you’re using an environment with limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include the polyfill shipped in [`@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code.
