# Omphalos — Core Theme blocks VQA route (diagnostic baseline, pre-implementation)

> **Purpose**: cut the route for the WordPress **Theme** block category (site
> identity, navigation, Query Loop + post-context blocks, post navigation, comments,
> term/archive). These blocks are CONTEXT-dependent (post / query / comment / term /
> site), so the route is decided BEFORE any pattern/CSS, per the diagnostic-first
> lock, and the VQA is split by context so invalid/fallback specimens don't mix.
> **Canonical source**: the RUNTIME registry (`WP_Block_Type_Registry`) — verified
> against this install. WordPress docs ([Blocks list](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks-list/),
> [Theme blocks category](https://wordpress.org/documentation/category/theme-blocks/))
> are SECONDARY: the category index is incomplete and uses pre-7.0 names, and the
> blocks-list is broader than what is actually registered.
> **Status**: route + registry reconciliation. No seed / pattern / CSS yet.
> **Date**: 2026-06-03 · WP 7.0 · M3 Expressive.

## §1 — Registry reconciliation (the load-bearing diagnostic)

This install registers **50 `category=theme` blocks**. Two traps the docs hide:

**A. The WP 7.0 "renames" are EDITOR LABELS only — the block NAME is unchanged.** VQA
markup must use the registered name or the block is invalid:

```txt
label "Title"          → core/post-title
label "Excerpt"        → core/post-excerpt
label "Featured Image" → core/post-featured-image
label "Author"         → core/post-author
label "Author Name"    → core/post-author-name
label "Author Bio"     → core/post-author-biography
label "Date"           → core/post-date
label "Tags"/"Categories" content → core/post-terms (one block, taxonomy attr)
label "Comments Form"  → core/post-comments-form
label "Time to Read"   → core/post-time-to-read
label "Comments Count" → core/post-comments-count
label "Comments Link"  → core/post-comments-link
```

**B. Several "blocks" are actually VARIATIONS of another block, or are NOT registered
at all here:**

```txt
VARIATIONS (not separate blocks):
  "Word Count"           = core/post-time-to-read variation
  "Modified Date"        = core/post-date variation (no core/post-modified-date)
  "Archive Title"        = core/query-title variation (no core/archive-title)
  "Search Results Title" = core/query-title variation (no core/search-results-title)

NOT REGISTERED here → EXCLUDE:
  core/post-types-label   (not in this WP build)
  core/posts-list         (deprecated / removed — "not replaced")
```

**Full registered theme set** (50): site-logo, site-title, site-tagline · navigation,
navigation-link, navigation-submenu, home-link, breadcrumbs · query, post-template,
query-no-results, query-pagination(+next/numbers/previous), query-title, query-total ·
post-content, post-title, post-excerpt, post-featured-image, post-date, post-terms,
post-author, post-author-name, post-author-biography, avatar, post-time-to-read,
read-more, post-navigation-link · post-comments-count, post-comments-link,
post-comments-form, post-comments(legacy) · comments, comment-template,
comment-author-name, comment-content, comment-date, comment-edit-link,
comment-reply-link, comments-title, comments-pagination(+next/numbers/previous) ·
term-name, term-count, term-description, term-template, terms-query · template-part,
loginout · pattern.

## §2 — Context dependency → split the VQA

A single page would mix invalid/fallback specimens, because each family needs its own
context:

```txt
Query Loop + post blocks → a query/postId context (the Post Template loop)
Comments family          → a comment context (a post WITH comments)
Term / Terms Query        → an archive / term context
Navigation / Template Part→ a site / template context
```

---

## §3 — VQA split

```txt
/vqa-theme/           Phase 1 — site identity · navigation · Query Loop + post meta
                                · post navigation · template infra
/vqa-theme-comments/  Phase 2 — Comments block family + Comments Form + the parked
                                Widgets Latest Comments
/vqa-theme-archive/   Phase 3 — Term blocks, Terms Query, query-title variations
                                (Archive/Search), + parked Widgets Archives /
                                Categories / Page List
```

---

## §4 — Phase 1 (`/vqa-theme/`) block set (registered names)

```txt
Site identity   core/site-logo · core/site-title · core/site-tagline
Navigation      core/navigation (+ core/navigation-link · core/navigation-submenu
                · core/home-link) · core/breadcrumbs
Query/Post      core/query > core/post-template > [ core/post-featured-image
                · core/post-title · core/post-excerpt · core/post-date
                · core/post-author (+ core/avatar / core/post-author-name)
                · core/post-terms · core/read-more · core/post-time-to-read
                · core/post-comments-count · core/post-comments-link ]
                + core/query-pagination · core/query-total
Post nav        core/post-navigation-link
Infra           core/template-part · core/loginout
```

Deferred out of Phase 1: comments family (§3 P2), term/terms-query + query-title
archive/search variations (§3 P3), Word Count (post-time-to-read variation, with P3),
post-content (already covered by prose/media/text VQA — minimal specimen only).
Excluded entirely: post-types-label, posts-list.

---

## §5 — Caveats (learned traps)

- **`core/navigation` is static-save + canonical-risk** (same trap as accordion /
  terms-query). Start from a MINIMAL menu and capture the canonical markup from the
  editor; do not hand-author a rich nav. Verify editor validity (no "block contains
  unexpected/invalid content") before trusting it.
- **`core/terms-query` / `core/term-template`** are also static-save containers →
  Phase 3, canonical-from-editor.
- **Query Loop is dynamic** and renders this install's real posts → the seed must
  supply enough posts (featured / no-featured), terms, authors, and prev/next context
  for the specimens to be meaningful.
- **`core/post-comments`** is the LEGACY comments block (deprecated in favour of
  `core/comments`); note it, don't specimen it.

---

## §6 — Write scope & validation plan

- **This step**: route only. Next: `seed-vqa-theme.php` (demo posts/pages/cats/tags/
  comments + featured/no-featured + prev/next), `patterns/vqa-theme.php` (Phase 1
  set), `seed.ps1` wiring. CSS-0 — observe registration / render / context / validity
  only, no theme CSS yet.
- **Validation**: `serialize_blocks(parse_blocks($body)) === $body` round-trip for the
  pattern; front-end render of every specimen (no PHP/console errors); editor opens
  the page with NO block-invalid warnings (esp. navigation). Computed CSS is a LATER
  step.

---

## §7 — CSS-0 observation → M3 component mapping (contract route)

Baseline observed on `/vqa-theme/` (current theme base, no theme-block CSS yet). The
load-bearing finding: **the Query-Loop post-meta blocks inherit the prose
always-underline link style** (they sit in `.wp-block-post-content`), so terms,
read-more, comments-link, and pagination all render as underlined primary BODY LINKS
with no structure — a wall of links, not an object card with a metadata cluster.

**Baseline computed (dark):**
```txt
nav-link    14 / on-surface / no-underline / no padding   (already text-link-ish)
breadcrumbs 16 / on-surface / "Home▮VQA Theme" no separator
terms       12 / primary / UNDERLINED                     (prose link)
read-more   16 / primary / UNDERLINED                     (prose link)
comments-lk 16 / primary / UNDERLINED                     (prose link)
pagination# 14 / primary / UNDERLINED                     (prose link)
date        12 / on-surface-variant                       (ok = body-small meta)
author-name 16 / on-surface                               (too big for meta vs date 12)
navigation  → renders the PAGE-LIST FALLBACK, not the inline menu (canonical risk).
```

**M3 component mapping (the contract route — observe-first, per priority A–F):**
```txt
A. Site identity + Navigation
   site-logo   → brand mark (size/align contract); site-title → title; tagline → body
   navigation  → Navigation Bar: items are TEXT links (NOT tabs/buttons); M3 spacing
                 + state layer; submenu → Menu SURFACE (surface-container + elevation)
   breadcrumbs → compact navigation aid: body-small links + a separator, on-surface-variant
B. Query Loop / Post Template → Card / List (reuse the collections ontology)
   list  → teaser-card stack ; grid → filled card grid ; featured-image → card media
   read-more → TEXT BUTTON (not a prose link)
C. Post-meta cluster (de-prose-ify — this is the biggest baseline gap)
   terms       → chips (assist/suggestion) OR de-underlined meta links
   date/author → body-small / on-surface-variant metadata row (one rhythm)
   comments-count/-link → text action, not a body link
D. Author identity
   avatar (size matrix) + author/author-name → compact identity row ;
   author-biography → supporting text
E. Pagination / Post navigation
   query-pagination(numbers/prev/next) → Pagination component (current-page emphasis);
   post-navigation-link → text link / nav button (mind the button-vs-link contract)
F. Comments family → separate phase (/vqa-theme-comments/), many M3 components mixed

First contracts: A (nav) + B (query-loop card/list). NOTE: navigation needs a real
`wp_navigation` menu (a bare nav falls back to the page list) before the
submenu/home-link/custom-link specimens are observable — seed one for the A contract.

---

## §8 — Theme blocks are CHROME, not prose (first contract — DONE)

The single biggest fix: theme blocks are template CHROME, so they must NOT inherit
the prose long-form link treatment (the §9 always-underline) nor the prose body size.

**Why the baseline looked wrong (the post-content-context trap):** the VQA renders
these blocks INSIDE `.wp-block-post-content`, where a real header/footer would render
them in a template part. So `core/site-title` (a `<p>`) inherited the 16px body size
(not TT5's ~22px header size, which comes from the header instance/context), and
every meta/title link inherited the prose underline+primary. This is a VQA-context
artifact AND a real leakage wherever a theme block is placed in content.

**Fix (blocks.css §18, first cut — loads after prose.css, ties+wins on order):**
- Site identity: `core/site-title` → **title-large (22/28)** GLOBALLY (a site/brand
  title, not a body line); `core/site-tagline` → body-small / on-surface-variant.
  Logo set via `-SetDemoLogo`; tagline seeded if empty (both site-owner data).
- De-prose-ify the theme-block links: post-title → on-surface HEADLINE (no resting
  underline), meta/nav links (terms, comments-count/-link, pagination,
  post-navigation-link) → on-surface-variant METADATA (no resting underline),
  read-more keeps the primary affordance; all underline on hover/focus only.

Verified computed (dark): site-title 22/28/400; tagline 12 on-surface-variant;
post-title on-surface no-underline; terms/comments/pagination on-surface-variant
no-underline; read-more primary no-underline.

**Still first-cut** (deferred to the per-family contracts §7): terms → chips,
read-more → text button, pagination component, the metadata-cluster layout, the
navigation/submenu surfaces, and bumping `core/post-title` to its card headline size
(the B contract).

---

## §9 — Navigation (A contract) — real-menu seed + CSS-0 DOM/overlay diagnosis

A bare `core/navigation` renders the **page-list fallback** (canonical risk, §5). So
the A contract first needs a real menu: `scripts/seed-vqa-theme.php` seeds an
idempotent `wp_navigation` post (slug `vqa-theme-nav`: home-link · About · Blog ·
More→[Categories · Tags] · loginout), and `patterns/vqa-theme.php` looks it up at
pattern-include time and references it via `{"ref":N}` (PHP-in-pattern runs at
registration). **Verified**: the specimen renders the ACTUAL menu (Home · About · Blog
· More · Categories · Tags · Log in), submenu present, NO page-list fallback.

**CSS-0 DOM/overlay diagnosis** (dark; wide 1000px + narrow 380px, no nav CSS yet):

```txt
DESKTOP (wide)
  nav            <nav> display:flex  (horizontal bar)
  nav item       <a> 14px / on-surface (rgb 230,224,233) / underline:NONE / pad:0
                 → already de-prosed by §18; reads as a text nav item
  submenu trig   a.wp-block-navigation-item__content + chevron SVG (has icon)
  submenu panel  position:absolute · visibility:hidden · opacity:0 (CSS hover/focus
                 toggle) · display:flex · bg rgb(20,18,24)  ← flat, NO elevation/shadow

MOBILE (narrow, overlayMenu:"mobile")
  toggle         <button> SVG-icon (hamburger) · 24×24 · color on-surface
  overlay open   position:fixed · inset:0 · bg rgb(20,18,24) OPAQUE · FULL-SCREEN
  close          <button> SVG-icon (X)
```

**Observed → M3 target (mapping notes, NOT contracts — no CSS this step):**

```txt
desktop nav item → M3 text nav item: §18 already did color/size/no-underline; the gap
                   is M3 spacing + a state layer (hover/focus/active), not type/color.
submenu panel    → M3 Menu SURFACE: surface-container + elevation (shadow) + corner +
                   padding. Currently a FLAT absolute dropdown with no elevation.
mobile toggle    → M3 ICON BUTTON, Material Symbols `menu`. Currently raw core SVG.
mobile overlay   → user wants a SIDE MODAL SHEET; core gives a FULL-SCREEN fixed
                   inset:0 modal. Gap = anchor to a side + max-inline-size + scrim
                   behind, not inset:0 fill.
close            → M3 ICON BUTTON, Material Symbols `menu_open` / `close`.
```

The three real gaps (item type/color already handled by §18): (1) submenu = flat
popover with no elevation; (2) overlay = full-screen, not a side sheet; (3)
toggle/close = raw core SVG, not M3 icon buttons. Backlog refs for the contract:
styleguide `#components-sheet` ("Static — side modal"), `lab-popover-pattern` (submenu
surface), icon-system (Material Symbols `menu`/`menu_open`).

### §9.1 — Submenu is CONTEXT-SENSITIVE (the load-bearing scoping rule)

A bare `.wp-block-navigation__submenu-container` must **never** be styled as a popover
globally — core/TT5 already lay it out two different ways (verified on this install):

```txt
header/horizontal (>=600px, hamburger hidden)
  submenu = position:ABSOLUTE detached dropdown, bg, boxShadow:NONE (reads FLAT)
  → M3 target: Menu SURFACE (tone + elevation + corner)
responsive overlay (<600px, .is-menu-open)
  submenu = position:STATIC, bg:transparent, no border/shadow, padding 19.2/32/0
  → already a COLLAPSIBLE nested nav section (NOT a popover); leave core's layout
```

**Breakpoint = exactly 600px** (sweep: hamburger <=599px, inline >=600px). So the
desktop dropdown-surface CSS lives entirely inside `@media (min-width:600px)`; below
600px no rule touches the submenu, so the overlay keeps its nested layout. NO reset
needed because no global popover rule exists. TT5 confirms the split — never collapse
the two contexts into one `.wp-block-navigation__submenu-container` popover patch.

### §9.2 — A1 + A2 implemented (blocks.css §19, DESKTOP-ONLY first cut — DONE)

- **A1 nav item** (both contexts, type only + de-underline): label-large (14/20/500,
  0.1px), resting underline removed (the post-content-scoped selector ties the §9
  prose rule and wins by order). Items are DESTINATION LINKS — no `.wp-element-button`.
- **A1 desktop state layer** (`@media min-width:600px`): item gets padding (4/8),
  corner-small radius, hover = on-surface @ 8%, focus-visible = on-surface @ 12% +
  primary outline. (Below 600px the overlay rows keep core's layout — A3.)
- **A2 desktop submenu surface** (`@media min-width:600px`): the container carries the
  `has-base-background-color` PRESET utility (`background-color: var(--wp--preset--
  color--base) !important`), so the surface tone MUST also be `!important` to win
  (specificity/order can't beat a preset important). → surface-container-high +
  outline-variant hairline + corner-small + elevation-shadow-level2 + menu-row padding.
  Dark suppresses shadow (tonal elevation), so the high surface tone + hairline
  delineate the menu; light gets the real shadow.

Verified computed: item 14/20/500 no-underline, hover on-surface@8%, radius 8px;
submenu dark bg rgb(43,41,48)=surface-container-high (vs page rgb(20,18,24)) shadow
none, light bg rgb(236,230,240) + real shadow; overlay submenu UNCHANGED
(static/transparent/no-shadow — no leak). Screenshots confirm a proper menu surface.

**Deferred (separate contracts):** A3 overlay side-sheet (full-screen `fixed inset:0`
→ side modal sheet + scrim + max-inline-size; leans on core interactivity/markup),
A4 toggle/close icon-button swap (raw core SVG → Material Symbols `menu`/`menu_open`;
needs icon-system + possibly markup/filter), and nav current/active treatment (until
the current-menu class is observed).

### §9.3 — VQA sitemap menu + overlay-visibility / nested / divider diagnosis

The 1-level "More" specimen was too shallow. The seed menu (`vqa-theme-nav`) was rebuilt
as a **VQA sitemap with 2–4 levels of nesting**, real `?page_id=` / `?attachment_id=`
permalinks (ASCII, mojibake-safe): Home · VQA → [Prose · Text · Media · Design · Widgets
· VQA Theme → [Embeds · Embed Template] · Attachments → [Images → [webp · jpeg · png ·
wide] · Audio · Video]] · Log in. Round-trip stable; nested depth verified (4 submenu
containers, max nest depth 3). The pattern now also carries three overlay-visibility
specimens (`never` / `mobile` / `always`), all `justifyContent:left` (deep submenus read
ragged when right-justified — the user's call; alignment follows the nav toolbar's
justify-items, a per-block layout attr).

**Header vs content context (resolves the "header reacts to theme color, content doesn't"
observation):** the omphalos `header` template part is just `<!-- wp:pattern
{"slug":"twentytwentyfive/header"} /-->` — so the real site-header nav is the **TT5
header pattern's** navigation, which sets overlay colors + justification, hence it reacts
to the theme. The `/vqa-theme/` nav is an in-`post-content` specimen WITHOUT those attrs,
so it looks default and — critically — its **interaction is NOT faithful**: the
hover-bridge between trigger and dropdown breaks in content (must click the
`__submenu-icon` toggle to traverse), while the header nav hovers fine. **Conclusion: the
content specimen is for DOM / structure / CSS-surface observation only; the canonical
INTERACTION + overlay-color context is the header/template-part nav.** (This is why we
never trusted the content nav for the hover path.)

**Overlay-visibility DOM/class (CSS-safety — verified):**
```txt
overlayMenu  nav class        hamburger @>=600   hamburger @<600   submenu when open
never        (no is-responsive) never            never             inline dropdown (A2 surface)
mobile       is-responsive      hidden           shown             <600 = overlay nested
always       is-responsive      SHOWN            shown             modal overlay at ALL widths
```
Visibility is baked into markup/classes (the open button gets `always-shown` for
`always`), NOT purely a media query — so `@media (min-width:600px)` is necessary but not
sufficient. **The leak the lock warned about, confirmed:** `always` opens the modal at
>=600px, where core resets the submenu `position`→static + `background`→transparent but
NOT `border-radius` / `border` / `box-shadow` / `min-width` — so A2 leaked a floating-card
look into the overlay's nested section. **Fixed (blocks.css §19 OVERLAY GUARD):**
`.wp-block-navigation__responsive-container.is-menu-open .…__submenu-container { reset
radius/border/shadow/min-width/bg }`, inside the same `@media (min-width:600px)`. Verified:
always-overlay-open @1000px submenu now radius 0 / static / transparent / no-shadow; the
inline desktop dropdown (mobile/never) keeps the surface (bg surface-container-high, radius
8, min 11rem). never-nav has no `.is-menu-open` so the guard never touches it.

**Nested flyouts:** each nested `__submenu-container` also gets the A2 surface (correct —
they're dropdown flyouts). Core positions child submenus `position:absolute` with NO
collision detection, so 3–4-deep flyouts can overflow the viewport edge — a real popover
positioning engine is out of CSS-only scope (defer; ref `lab-popover-pattern`).

**Divider probe (isolated render, menu never at risk):** `core/separator` inside a nav
submenu round-trips stable and renders an `<hr>` — but as a non-`<li>` child of the menu
`<ul>` (structurally questionable), and the editor inserter likely won't expose it
(seed-only). `core/spacer` likewise valid. For a menu divider, full-width
(`is-style-wide`) is the natural choice, but a CSS-drawn row separator is the cleaner
route than a seeded `<hr>` — **deferred** until a divider is actually needed in the menu.

**Still deferred / next:** A3 overlay = side modal sheet (now doubly motivated — `always`
makes the full-screen `fixed inset:0` overlay a desktop surface too; needs scrim +
max-inline-size + collapsible sections, leans on core interactivity), A4 icon-button
toggle, nav current/active, and the nested-flyout positioning engine.

### §9.4 — A2 cleanup (M3-faithful, core-leaning — corrected over the first cut)

Review caught over-correction + wrong targets in the first A2 cut. Reworked (blocks.css
§19 rewrite), verified dark+light:

- **Surface = `surface-container-low`, NO border** (was `surface-container-high` +
  outline-variant hairline — too bright / over-skinned; M3 standard menu is
  surface-container-low). Dark page base = rgb(20,18,24), surface-container-low =
  rgb(29,27,32) — still a tone above base, so it lifts WITHOUT shadow (dark suppresses
  shadow); light keeps elevation-shadow-level2.
- **State layer on the ROW (`li`), not the anchor** (M3 menu item: the row owns the
  state layer). on-surface @ 8% hover / 12% focus-within. **Submenu rows only** —
  top-level stays conservative.
- **Top-level typography/padding LEFT TO CORE.** The first cut forced label-large
  (line-height 20) + padding on the top-level anchor, which shifted the front-end
  baseline ~1px vs header/editor (the reported bug). Now only de-underline + a
  conservative hover underline (no box, geometry stays core's; top-level computed pad
  0/0, line-height 24 = core).
- **Overlay = fully core via a single-direction gate** (no skin+reset). Gate =
  `nav.wp-block-navigation:not(:has(.…responsive-container.is-menu-open))`. **The leading
  `nav` type selector is load-bearing**: the INNER `<ul
  class="wp-block-navigation__container wp-block-navigation">` also carries the
  `wp-block-navigation` class but sits *inside* the responsive container, so a class-only
  gate is satisfied by that inner ul (no is-menu-open descendant) and the skin leaks back
  into the open overlay — only the outer `<nav>` both carries the class and *contains* the
  responsive container. Verified: always-overlay-open @1000px submenu = static /
  transparent / radius 0 / no-shadow (fully core); this also fixes the reported
  desktop≠mobile color difference for `always`.
- **Menu item description support.** `core/navigation-link` has a `description` attr and
  renders it, but core hides it (`.…item__description { display:none }`) unless the theme
  opts in. We opt in for the INLINE menu (gated; overlay stays core) → M3 label +
  supporting text (body-small / on-surface-variant). Two seed items carry a description
  specimen.

**Sitemap shrunk** (was over-stuffed): Home · VQA → [Prose · Text · Media · Design ·
Widgets · VQA Theme → [VQA Comments · VQA Archive — the FUTURE Phase-2/3 subpages, the
real reason to nest]] · Log in. Embeds / Embed Template / Attachment links pulled (they
belong in their own lanes / a footer site-map, not the Theme nav).

### §9.5 — A2 follow-up (M3 Menu spec values + sys.state tokens + fixes)

Second review pass — measured corrections against the M3 standard Menu spec, plus a
sitemap re-expansion (the shrink over-corrected). blocks.css §19 reworked as ONE gated
nested block (`nav.…:not(:has(.is-menu-open))`, the `nav` type still load-bearing);
verified dark+light:

- **Baseline (the 1px).** Cause found: the top-level submenu trigger `li.wp-block-
  navigation-submenu` carries a stray `margin-block-start: ~4px` (not in our CSS — core/
  TT5), dropping the submenu label below its non-submenu siblings. Zeroed it (gated) →
  Home / VQA / Log in now share one top (725.6 == 725.6).
- **State layer on the ROW (`li`), top-level INCLUDED.** First cleanup removed top-level
  hover entirely; restored as a li state layer (covers label + trailing icon), NO box
  padding so top-level geometry stays core. NO hover underline. Opacities now come from
  `--md-sys-state-{hover,focus}-state-layer-opacity` (0.08 / 0.10), not hardcoded.
- **Nested trailing chevron was BLACK.** `.…__submenu-icon` in the dropdown rendered
  rgb(0,0,0) (its button color didn't inherit the theme color); top-level was fine. Set
  to on-surface-variant (M3 trailing icon) + transparent bg (so it doesn't double the row
  state layer).
- **M3 Menu spec values.** Container = surface-container-low · NO border · corner-large
  (16dp) · elevation-shadow-level2 (light) / tonal lift (dark) · group padding/gap 2 ·
  NO overflow:hidden (it would clip the nested flyouts — overflow stays visible). Rows =
  middle corner-extra-small (4dp), first/last outer corners 12dp · label-large
  (14/20/500/0.1) · min-block-size 48 · padding 8/12 · trailing icon 20 · supporting
  text body-small (12/16/400/0.4) on-surface-variant.
- **Focus indicator tokens (NEW).** Audit: `--md-sys-state-*-state-layer-opacity` already
  existed (reused, NOT reinvented); the focus-ring MECHANICS did not, so added to
  `tokens.sys.core.css` §6: `--md-sys-state-focus-indicator-{thickness:3px, outer-offset:
  2px, inner-offset:-3px}` (color stays role-chosen = secondary). §19 uses outer-offset
  on the top-level pill, inner-offset on menu rows (so the ring isn't clipped). NOTE: the
  pre-existing hardcoded focus rings (`.wp-element-button:focus-visible` 3px/+2, block
  focus rings) can adopt these tokens in a later sweep — left untouched here (no naming
  sweep this turn).

### §9.6 — Dropdown Menu measurements vs Nav-rail-like navigation (locked)

Apply **Menu/Popover measurements only to horizontal inline dropdown submenus**. The
navigation block has other modes that are not menus:

- `overlayMenu: always` / mobile overlay: a responsive overlay with in-flow nested
  submenu sections.
- `orientation: vertical` + `overlayMenu: never` + always-visible submenus: visually
  closer to an expanded navigation rail / drawer than a popover menu.

**Class signals (verified, PHP render + DOM):** `submenuVisibility` enum = `hover` /
`click` / `always` (default hover); `always` puts `.open-always` on the submenu li (a
static, always-open nested list). `orientation: vertical` puts `.is-vertical` on the
`<nav>`. Overlay open = `.…responsive-container.is-menu-open`. hover/click both produce a
FLOATING absolute dropdown (= Menu), including vertical `submenuVisibility:click`.
Only always-expanded and overlay states are nested sections.

Therefore the Menu contract is gated to the floating dropdown with TWO exclusions:

```css
nav.wp-block-navigation:not(:has(.open-always)):not(:has(.…responsive-container.is-menu-open)) { … }
```

The leading `nav` type is load-bearing (the inner container ul also carries the class).
Do **not** style `.wp-block-navigation__submenu-container` globally as a menu. Verified
(2c specimens): vertical `submenuVisibility:click` gets the Menu popover surface
(surface-container-low, radius 16, 48dp rows), while `submenuVisibility:always` stays a
transparent always-expanded tree and does not receive the Menu skin. **NOTE:**
`submenuVisibility:always` is only coherent for a VERTICAL nav (an always-expanded
rail/tree); on a horizontal nav the submenu is an absolute dropdown, so "always-open"
has no meaningful state — the editor does not honor horizontal+always (front renders the
`.open-always` class but it is not an editor-faithful config). The Nav rail / drawer lane
(vertical / always) is SEPARATE and must not inherit the dropdown measurements.

**Row ownership = the `li` (M3 menu item).** The first cut put the row box (min-height +
padding) on the ANCHOR, which is wrong — the row, state layer, hit area, height and item
padding belong to the `li`; the anchor (label) and the toggle button are content/action
SLOTS inside it. Corrected:

```txt
ul  …__submenu-container   padding 2 / 4 (block/inline) · gap 2 · surface-container-low · radius 16 · overflow visible
li  …navigation-item       min-block-size 48 · padding-inline 12 · gap 8 · shape 4 (first/last outer 12)
                           → state layer + hit area + height live here
a   …__content             padding 0 · min-block-size auto · flex-grow 1 · label/supporting typography only
button …__submenu-icon     20px slot · margin 0 (core gives ~3.5px → zeroed) · Material Symbols arrow_right
effective leading/trailing = ul 4 + li 12 = 16 ; a↔button gap = 8 (verified exact)
```

**Prose-list leak (all nav contexts).** prose.css indents every post-content
`:is(ul,ol)` (`padding-inline-start: --space-xl = 32px`); that leaks onto the nav
container + submenu uls, pushing the depth-1 items (Home / submenu) 32px right of
`loginout` (which core renders OUTSIDE the container ul) — visible only on the front
(prose.css doesn't reach the editor canvas the same way). Reset in blocks.css §19
(un-gated, post-content-scoped): nav uls get `padding-inline-start:0` + `list-style:none`,
so depth-1 items share one line in EVERY orientation. The gated Menu submenu padding
(2/4) still wins by specificity for the horizontal dropdown.

`a` is `flex-grow:1` on EVERY submenu row, leaf items included — a leaf anchor grows to
fill the remaining row width, so its click/hit area becomes the FULL row (a deliberate
change from core's content-width hit area; a full-row target is the menu norm). State
layer is on the `li`; focus targets stay the real focusables (`a` / `button`).

**Navigation taxonomy (corrected — Tabs removed):**
```txt
horizontal WP navigation        ≈ M3 Navigation BAR (role: horizontal destination switch).
                                  WP nav is text-only by default; M3 nav bar is icon-led →
                                  not a 1:1 map, but closer to Nav bar than Tabs.
vertical / submenuVisibility:always / overlay nested
                                ≈ Navigation RAIL (expanded) / drawer-like nested nav.
                                  NOT a Menu/Popover — the dropdown measurements are forbidden.
collapsed rail                  = a SEPARATE later lane (the earlier "overlaps Tabs" framing
                                  was inaccurate; it is Nav rail collapsed, not Tabs).
```

### §9.6b — A2b horizontal nav root = "Nav bar-LITE" (header-nav bridge, NOT full adoption)

Closed so far is ONLY A2a (horizontal submenu dropdown = Menu/Popover). The horizontal
nav ROOT (A2b) and the vertical root (A2c, nav-rail) and overlay (A3) are still open.

A2b is NOT a full M3 Nav bar component port — the WP horizontal nav root is usually
HEADER-TEMPLATE CHROME, so forcing the standalone bottom-nav geometry (64dp container,
item gap 0, 40/16 pills, 12dp label) would over-occupy the header. Split of ownership:

```txt
theme owns          item SHAPE (corner-full pill) · state layer (hover/focus/pressed) ·
                    current-page active INDICATOR (secondary-container pill + secondary label)
header/template owns container height · gap · justify · item external spacing · row rhythm
deferred / review   inactive label color (on-surface-variant candidate) · 12dp label-medium
                    (lab reference; header nav keeps label-large 14) · container height /
                    gap / justify (left to header/template — NO 64dp container, NO gap)
```

Implemented (blocks.css §19, inside the horizontal gate): top-level item → the M3 nav-bar
horizontal ACTIVE-INDICATOR geometry — `min-block-size: 40` (indicator height 40dp) ·
`padding-inline: 16` (leading/trailing 16dp) · `corner-full` (pill) · flex/align-center;
current item (`:has(> a[aria-current="page"])`) → secondary-container bg + secondary label.
The 40/16 is the INDICATOR (item) spec, not the CONTAINER (the 64dp container / gap /
justify stay with the header/template). Verified (front, dark+light): item 40px tall, pad
16, radius corner-full; rest = transparent; current = secondary-container pill (#4A4458) +
secondary label; non-current hover = on-surface @ 0.08 pill; label stays 14. NOTE: the
current-item pill currently suppresses the hover state layer (both set `background-color`);
a ::before state-layer overlay (the lab `.nav-bar__item::before` pattern) is the refinement
for active+hover layering — deferred. (loginout renders OUTSIDE the container ul, so the
pill treatment doesn't reach "Log in" yet — a separate structural item.)

### §9.6c — A2c open-always vertical = light BASELINE SKIN (blocks.css §20) + RAIL deferred

**ROLLED BACK from a full expanded-rail to a light skin.** An earlier §20 implemented the
M3 EXPANDED RAIL on `nav.is-vertical:has(.open-always)` — forced rail width (220),
re-implemented `justifyContent` with margin-auto (incl. a loginout-must-match-the-container
symmetry), `flex-wrap:nowrap`, `align-items:stretch`, full-width 56dp pills, box-sizing,
nested-padding `!important`, a content-width-block-vs-rail-width split. That **OWNED layout
that core/navigation already does** (orientation · flexWrap · justifyContent/alignment ·
container width · static nested layout · depth indent) → it LOWERED core dependency and
FOUGHT the editor toolbar (align/justify doing two conflicting things on two layers). It
also wrongly equated `open-always` with a 220px rail: an always-open vertical nav is a TREE
/ expanded-section candidate, not necessarily an M3 rail, and deep nesting (depth 3-4 →
label clamped to ~105px) is a tree/flyout problem, not an in-place-rail one.

**Now core OWNS** orientation · flexWrap · justifyContent/alignment · container width ·
static nested layout · depth indent. The **theme keeps a light skin only**, on
`nav.is-vertical:has(.open-always)`:
```txt
item ROW capsule        on the LI (per review — per-anchor read messy). `li.…-item`:
                        `min-block-size:56` · logical `padding-inline:16` · `position:
                        relative`. The hover/current capsule is a `::before` (corner-full),
                        full-width by inset, painted by STATE: `:hover::before` →
                        on-surface 0.08; `:has(> a[aria-current="page"])::before` →
                        secondary-container. The `::before` is CLAMPED to `block-size:56`
                        (the trigger ROW) so a vertical PARENT li — which wraps its whole
                        nested subtree — is NOT tinted/rounded as one giant box, only its
                        top row; a LEAF li override gives `::before{block-size:100%}`.
                        focus ring stays on the focusable anchor (a11y).
current-page indicator  `li:has(> a[aria-current="page"])::before` → filled secondary-
                        container capsule; `> a[aria-current]` → secondary label.
supporting text         core hides description (display:none) → opt in (display:block,
                        body-small/on-surface-variant); the content stacks label + supporting
                        text via flex-column `:has(.description)`.
submenu (parent) row     the parent li wraps its subtree, but it still owns the trigger
                        row geometry: `li.wp-block-navigation-submenu` gets
                        `min-block-size:56` + logical padding-inline 16. The first
                        `.…__content` (anchor/button) and trailing submenu icon are slots
                        inside that row: content grows, has 56px block-size, and keeps
                        padding-inline 0; open-always nested content overrides core's
                        `flex-grow:0`, and open-always parent triggers use `inline-size:100%`
                        so leaf + submenu-heading rows both fill their row. The following
                        submenu `ul` wraps to the next row.
gap / margin            core's vertical submenu gap is `gap: var(--wp--style--block-gap)`
                        (1.2rem ≈ 19.2px) — too large on the BLOCK axis. Do NOT zero the
                        variable: core also uses it for the INLINE nested indent. Override
                        only `row-gap:0` on the nav/submenu containers (with enough priority
                        to beat the generated layout rule), leaving `column-gap` / inline
                        padding / depth indent core-owned. Drop the stray 4px
                        `margin-block-start` on the submenu li.
justification edge      for vertical submenu children, remove padding on the opposite edge
                        only: left-justified → `padding-inline-end:0`; right-justified →
                        `padding-inline-start:0`. This keeps the needed hierarchy
                        indent while letting the active edge align cleanly. Description
                        anchors follow the same justification (`text-align:start/end`,
                        `align-items:flex-start/end`), so label + supporting text align
                        together.
core still owns          width · flexWrap · justifyContent · alignment · flow · inline
                        depth indent (no nav-level width / justify re-implementation /
                        block-gap variable override).
```
prose ul-indent leak removal + link de-underline already live in §19 (un-gated). Applies to
BOTH 2c vertical variants (click = core submenu behavior; always = open tree). Verified
(front, dark): leaf content 56 / padding-inline 16 / corner-full / full-width; the VQA
submenu toggle is a full-width 56 capsule trigger (no subtree tint / no giant rounded box);
current = filled capsule. = core tree nav + full-row capsule affordance.

**The real M3 EXPANDED RAIL is DEFERRED to an explicit opt-in** — a block style variation
`.is-style-expanded-rail` or a template/sidebar context class (e.g. `.ax-navigation-rail`)
— where a defined width (220, ceiling 360) + single-column + full-width pill rows +
loginout-merge + indent clamp / deep-level right-popover become justified. `:has(.open-
always)` alone is not "a rail"; the rail needs a real header/sidebar template context.

**M3 Nav rail spec (reference for the opt-in)** — the EXPANDED rail item is the M3 *Horizontal*
item variant (icon+label ROW; WP is label-only); the COLLAPSED rail is the *Vertical*
item (icon-over-label, icon-first) → EXCLUDED for text-only WP nav.
```txt
container (standalone)  width clamp(220, 360) · top-space 44 · elevation 0 · color surface ·
                        shape 0   (NOT 16 — 16 is the MODAL variant only)
container (modal sheet) elevation 3 · color surface-container-high · shape 16   (→ A3 territory)
item                    height 56 (short) / 64 · container shape 0 · vertical gap 6
  label                 label-large 14/20/500/0.1   (NB: nav BAR item is 12dp; rail item is 14dp)
  active indicator      FULL-WIDTH · height 56 · circular (corner-full) · leading 16 / trailing 16
                        · icon-label 8 · icon 24
states                  active indicator = secondary-container · active label = secondary ·
                        inactive label = on-surface-variant · hover 0.08 / focus 0.10 / pressed 0.10
collapsed (excluded)    container 96 (narrow 80) · vertical item · label-medium 12/16/500/0.5 ·
                        indicator 56×32 around the icon · top-space 44 · item gap 4
```
So the rolled-back §20 rail was ~correct EXCEPT: container shape should be 0 (not 16; 16 = modal
only) + color surface + top-space 44 + item gap 6 + width clamp(220,360).

**RAIL OPT-IN ATTEMPT (§21) — BUILT then FULLY ROLLED BACK.** A first cut put the rail behind
`.is-style-expanded-rail` with the M3 values, but it re-introduced everything the theme should
NOT own: fixed/clamped width, `align-items:stretch`, `inline-size:100%` full-width rows, AND a
re-interpretation of `justifyContent` as the rail BLOCK position via `margin-inline-*
!important` (to beat the post-content centering). That violates the project's logical-property +
RTL/LTR-first + **core-owns-layout** principles: `items-justified-right` is not necessarily the
visual right (it flips under RTL, and WP's mapping of justify on a vertical nav is core's to
own), and `!important` margin overrides + a fixed component width are exactly the core-fight we
keep removing. So §21 was **deleted in full** (CSS + the pattern specimen).

**A2c is CLOSED at the §20 capsule skin** — core owns ALL layout (width / flexWrap /
justifyContent / alignment / indent / flow), the theme adds only: de-underline (§19) ·
capsule SHAPE (corner-full) + logical `padding-inline` · hover/focus/current STATE · supporting
text. No width / margin / justify re-implementation / `!important` / fixed rail. RTL/LTR flow
stays core-native. The real EXPANDED RAIL is deferred to a SEPARATE component/template lane and
must be re-specced with a full RTL audit (the M3 Nav rail values above are the reference) before
any rebuild — `:has(.open-always)` + a content nav is not a rail.

### §9.6d — vertical + submenuVisibility:click accordion = PLUGIN / render lane (rolled back)

A vertical click-to-open submenu would read better as an in-flow ACCORDION / disclosure than
a floating popover. Verified DOM: `li.open-on-click > button.…__toggle[aria-expanded]` + a
SIBLING `ul.…__submenu-container` (core's collapsed state = `position:absolute;
visibility:hidden`). A CSS-only prototype re-flowed it with `flex-wrap`, `position:static`,
`max-block-size`, and sibling selectors, but it kept fighting core/navigation's saved markup
and interaction model (submenu placement, nested flow, height semantics, and no real
`<details>` semantics). **That prototype was removed from theme CSS.**

Decision: **do not implement accordion behavior in the theme baseline.** Keep the current
core `submenuVisibility:"click"` behavior as core-owned. If accordion/details behavior is
wanted, build it as a plugin / block extension / `render_block` lane that can own markup and
semantics (`details/summary` or a proper disclosure controller), then test editor + front +
RTL together. Theme CSS may keep the neutral vertical item capsule skin (§20), but it must
not re-flow click submenus.

Current measured dropdown values (front, dark, `/vqa-theme/`):

```txt
container: bg surface-container-low · border 0 · radius 16 · padding 2/4 · gap 2 · overflow visible
row(li):   middle radius 4 · first/last outer radius 12 · min-block-size 48 · padding-inline 12 · gap 8
anchor(a): padding 0 · min-block-size auto · flex-grow 1 · label-large 14/20/500/0.1
support:   body-small 12/16/400/0.4 · on-surface-variant · margin-top 2
trailing:  Material Symbols arrow_right · 20 · on-surface-variant · margin 0 ; gap 8 / trailing inset 16 (exact)
overlay/open-always: core / tree (no Menu skin) — verified excluded
vertical click: Menu popover applies (same surface/48dp rows as horizontal)
```

### §9.6e — Submenu trailing affordance ontology (where the icon spec comes from)

A `core/navigation` submenu chevron is a TRAILING AFFORDANCE, and its measurement must be
sourced from the right component ontology — NOT from Navigation itself. **Nav bar / Nav rail
carry no trailing-icon spec**: their icon slots are destination PRIMARIES (the leading symbol
of a destination), so they are not a basis for a submenu indicator. The two valid sources are
**Menu** (cascading-submenu indicator: trailing icon 20dp, on-surface-variant) and **List**
(row-level disclosure / expandable parent: trailing icon 24dp, on-surface-variant; a future
stronger target is the List expanded-parent 40dp corner-full container). **Chip**'s icon
(18dp) is component-private and must NOT be pulled into navigation. Mapping applied:

```txt
nested popover submenu  = Menu cascading indicator   → arrow_right        / 20 / on-surface-variant   (blocks.css §19b)
top-level submenu        = List row disclosure         → arrow_drop_down/up / 24 / on-surface-variant   (blocks.css §19c)
open-always tree         = Nav-rail baseline           → no trailing icon (showSubmenuIcon:false)
chip                     = chip-private (18)           → NOT used in navigation
```

The top-level disclosure replaces core's caret `<svg>` for both core markups — a `<span>`
(`submenuVisibility:"click"`) and a `<button>` toggle (hover) — with the expanded state
swapping to `arrow_drop_up` (click: `button[aria-expanded] ~ icon`; hover: `icon[aria-expanded]`).
Source measures: Menu / List / Chip rows in `axismundi-lab/stylesheets/components.css`
(Menu ~3001, List ~4300, Chip ~1733).
